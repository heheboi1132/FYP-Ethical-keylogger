# FYP-Ethical-keylogger
Ethical keylogger for final year project assignments

ATTENTION ! ! ! 
If you really want to put this software to work in real life, you have to turn on the two-factor authentication feature on your gmail. At your gmail, click on Manage Your Google Account and go to Security tab and look for App password section. It should be right below your Two Factor Authentication section, and make an app password for your keylogger. With that, the application won't actually need your ACTUAL gmail password to login since it uses your account as a sender.
